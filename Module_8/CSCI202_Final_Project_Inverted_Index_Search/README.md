Purpose: This program is my CSCI202 (Data Structures class) Final Project. 
	I will be using an Inverse Index to perform an advanced text search of a text file supplied by the user. 
	Fuzzy Search will be implemented through usage of a Levenshtein Distance algorithm. 
	The program will be a GUI C++ project that uses the Windows Desktop Application framework.
